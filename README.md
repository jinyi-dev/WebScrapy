## Usin Python and Scrapy framework to scripe information form web site : book.toscrape.com.

The purpose of this project is to scrape out info on the web for,'book name','price','rating','in stock' information, and save it to CSV file
I also strip out the price to number without £ in front of it,  (£32.55 to 32.55) so it is easy for you do analysis later.

Check wiki in this Respo for detailed stepd to creat the same result.
